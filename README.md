**Description:** ChromaTeeK is a maintained fork of the Chroma Beat Saber mod. It preserves Chroma's in-game behaviour (maps and other mods will still recognise it as "Chroma") while using a distinct distributable name so it’s easy to distinguish between different Chroma builds.

**Tested Platform:** Meta Quest 3 (tested only on Quest 3)

**Version / Testing Notes:**
- Renamed package to "ChromaTeeK" to avoid confusion with other Chroma releases.
- As of 22/01/2026 the mod has undergone excessive developer testing and roughly 5 hours of in-game testing without any issues observed.

**What it does:**
- Brings Chroma lighting, colorizers and environment enhancements to Beat Saber on Quest.
- Keeps compatibility so existing Chroma-compatible maps and plugins recognize and work with it.

**Known Bugs / Limitations:**
- Old maps (created via older engines) may be laggy. This is a behaviour of engine differences and map optimizations, not something introduced by my work.
- No other issues are currently known — if you find something, please open an issue. Don't forget detailed description with all how's, when's, etc...

**Credits:**
- Original Chroma created by Aeroluna (thank you — original work from ~5 years ago is the foundation of this project).

**Maintenance:**
If appreciated, I will do my best to keep ChromaTeeK alive and updated for every major Beat Saber update.

**Reporting Issues:**
Please open a new issue in this repository if you encounter bugs or unexpected behaviour. Include your Beat Saber version, device (Meta Quest 3), steps to reproduce and any relevant logs.

_Tested only on Meta Quest 3. If you test on other devices and have feedback, please report it so this project can expand compatibility testing._
