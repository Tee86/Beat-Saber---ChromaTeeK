_(If too long, read TL;DR at the bottom)_

## Hi there, 
I hope you're all having a wonderful day...<br> It turned out I have to put out these "few" lines to clear things up as yesterday (22/01/2026), when I released ChromaTeeK, I was literally attacked by some individuals who think they consumed all the knowledge there is, and sadly they think the world needs to hear their opinions as well (literally relies on them). There were some constructive enquiries (eg from Fern (bsq-ports) - see in Issues) that I really appreciate, and have nothing against them. However, there were also some attacks from internet trolls that are borderline slander and I seriously consider legal action against them. Last but not least, there was also an overwhelming grateful support - I genuinely thank every each of you, but next lines are more focused on the previously mentioned group of people. 

<h1 align="center">↓ First, let me clarify ↓</h1>

- I am **NOT** associated with so-called "official Beat Saber modders" in any way - I never claimed I was, so it's difficult to comprehend that I need to clarify that, but never mind - just done it, so the box is ticked ✓

<h1 align="center">Why ChromaTeeK (CTK for short) was created?</h1>

- CTK was created because Beat Saber (BS for short) is one of two games I play, and it is the only one game I play with my lovely wife 😘 (and due to that it has a very special place in my heart). We play only Party mode, and compete just with each other, but it's still super fun and also a good exercise - I can't get my heart rate past 180 anywhere else 😅
- So why CTK? I believe that I am not the only one who is irritated by the following:
  - BS 1.37 was released on June 4, 2024 → Chroma from bsq-ports followed shortly after (Jun 27) 🎆AMAZING!
  - BS 1.38 was released on October 8, 2024 → no Chroma
  - BS 1.39 was released on November 29, 2024 → no Chroma
  - BS 1.40 was released on December, 2024 → no Chroma

Due to the above, we all are (Quest BS players) forced to play an old, not updated, release of the game (if we want to play Chroma maps). With all due respect, Chroma is not a rocket science, and having 18 months gaps between releases does not strike me as okay. It's more like the project is abandoned (although there is some activity now and then, but no release). That's why CTK was created and released.

<h1 align="center">Clarification number 2:</h1>

- Although I explicitly stated it in readme, I obviously have to repeat myself. CTK is port of Chroma, and it has been rebranded with "TeeK" appendix, so you (end-users) can super easily distinguish that "Aha, okay, this is not the version from `bsq-ports`
- I thought that it goes without saying that if something is not from `bsq-ports` → if `bsq` releases something else (eg Chroma, or Noodles, or Vivify), or any other mod → the end-user is intelligent enough to comprehend that if they want to install it, they also need to satisfy all dependencies that such bsq's mod would have (e.g. Chroma → NOT ChromaTeek).

<h1 align="center">Maaan, I was wrong...</h1>

- I mean, it's kind of like when your BMW breaks down → you're not gonna visit Tesla shop (or will ya? I'm kind of lost here - should I expect so little from people?). My expectation is that if a person was able to mod BS - said person is also equipped with a human, fully functional, developed brain.
- It seems like so-called "official BS modders" think that you (end-users) are mind-less sheep as I was sent several screenshots from people from Reddit who received DM's that are directly shaming and slander me. (considering legal action)
Maybe I'll paste a screenshot later (have to verify whether it is legally okay to paste a DM with 1-party consent only)
- In summary those messages say that the code was STOLEN, it was made with AI, it may have bugs, and so on...
- Here I have to take credit (humbly tho), as apparently I am the first person in the history of the planet Earth that managed to steal an open-source code. Now, I'm not really sure what goal should I set next in my life - as I'm not quite sure what can exceed this accomplishment.
- *"made with AI"*: 😵‍💫🤦‍♀️🤷‍♂️👻👻👻OMG, somebody, call 9-1-1!
  - I believe 90% of code is made with AI help these days, maybe even more than that
  - jeez, even such a stupid thing as commit's note is generated by AI on GitHub, automatically - it doesn't even ask you if you want it.
  - Google, Amazon, Meta, every other major company, literally over 90% of GitHub repo's, so I am not gonna lie that I haven't touched AI.
  - The project was indeed coded with AI's help, but no **BY** AI!
- *"may have bugs"* : yeah, because there wasn't a single mod released by so-called "official BS modders" that had a single bug. I'm not there yet, it really is true (most likely) - CTK may have bugs. Please, if you encounter any, report them here, and they will be fixed.




<h1 align="center">↓ At last (to state the obvious), and summarize this statement aka TL;DR ↓</h1>

<h5 align="center">- This project is NOT maintained by so-called "Official Beat Saber Modders Group"</h5>
<h5 align="center">- I am not a member of so-called "Official Beat Saber Modders Group"</h5>
<h5 align="center">- so-called "Official Beat Saber Modders Group" does not govern me in any way</h5>
<h5 align="center">- I delivered ChromaTeeK mainly to bridge a gap between the official Chroma releases (made by bsq-ports) - as in my books, an 18-month gap is a HUGE gap; consequentially you can enjoy Chroma enhanced environments (and play maps that have Chroma as requirement) when playing on standalone Quest, the same way I enjoy it when I'm partying with my wife.</h5>
<h5 align="center">- Do not mistake ChromaTeeK (maintained by Tee - as the name suggests) with Chroma (maintained by bsq-ports)</h5>
<h5 align="center">- ChromaTeeK is free for everyone, feel free to use it if you want. If you don't, then don't.</h5>
